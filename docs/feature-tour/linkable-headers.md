# Linkable Headers
If youâ€™re using Doxter to write documentation or long-form content, this is a must.

Having the ability to link directly a specific section within an article is very important for easy to navigate documentation.

This is what linkable headers do. 

For every header level you consider important, Doxter can make sure that it gets a named anchor so that you can link to it directly.
