# Editor
The Doxter editor was designed to be used by developers and content editors alike. It attempts to make markdown more accessible to those who are less technical or haven’t written markdown before.

It also provides deep integration with Craft and the control panel.

## Parser
The Doxter parser is more than a parser, it’s actually a set of parsers that work together to provide an incredibly smart conversion.

Markdown is now a first-class citizen in Craft CMS, but beyond that, Doxter makes working with Code Blocks and Shortcodes a joy.

## Typography
Here are a few of the styles that Doxter applies to your content:

- Straight quotes into “curly” quote HTML entities
- Backtick style quotes into “curly” quote HTML entities
- Dashes into **en-dash** and **em-dash** entities
- Three consecutive dots into an ellipsis entity
- French guillemets into true « guillemets » HTML entities.
- Comma-style quotes into their curly equivalent.
- Replace existing spaces with non-break where appropriate
