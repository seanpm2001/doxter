# Reference Tags
No more stale links to other entries because someone changed the slug

Reference tags are similar to **shortcodes** in that they are short snippets that return dynamic content. For reference tags, the content comes from **Craft Elements** such as users, entries, categories, etc.

The Craft docs for [Reference Tags](http://buildwithcraft.com/docs/reference-tags) gives a pretty in-depth explanation of what they are and how to use them.

Doxter adheres to Craftâ€™s parsing rules when processing reference tags and they get parsed before the markdown gets parsed, allowing for some pretty awesome functionality.
